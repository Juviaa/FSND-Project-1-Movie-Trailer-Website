Description
A website that plays the trailers for my six favorite movies.

Credits
Each trailer is copyright to the film's production company.
I primarily used Udacity's course material in creating this project. I also used https://www.learnpython.org/ as a general resource, but did not use any code from there or any other external source other than Udacity. fresh_tomatoes.html and fresh_tomoatoes.py were pre-written. media.py is my own work.
