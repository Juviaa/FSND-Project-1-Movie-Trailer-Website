Fullstack Web Developer Nanodegree Program Project 1: Movie Trailer Website

### Author
Franklin Gray (GitHub: asmallbeast)

### Description
A website that plays the trailers for my six favorite movies.

### How to use
Run the file entertainment_center.py from your Terminal using the command:
$ python Your/File/Path/entertainment_center.py

### Credits
Each trailer is copyright to the film's production company.

I primarily used Udacity's course material in creating this project. I also used https://www.learnpython.org/ as a general resource, but did not use any code from there or any other external source other than Udacity. entertainment_center.py, fresh_tomatoes.html, and fresh_tomoatoes.py were pre-written. media.py is my own work.
